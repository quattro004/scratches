    A dragon descends on your castle, breathing fire and destroying all in its path. The inhabitants scatter and flee, you're left all alone
       with a sinking sensation that something bad has happened. The local wizard has been notified and will soon appear on the scene to pick
       up the pieces. The castle may have to be rebuilt. If you continue to receive this message please do not give up hope, all is not lost.
