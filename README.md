<p>This application provides the ability to manage your digital media (audio, video, pictures, etc.) and provides a user interface that
   will allow ease of retrieval. The problem it tries to solve is that in the digital age we are amassing a large quantity of digital
   media and while there are many solutions to store it, such as in the cloud, there aren't a lot of solutions that allow you to retrieve
   and view the content easily.
